            <h3>Estimating the drift of dead whales </h3>
            <a name=20141112><em>12 November 2014</em></a>

            <p>A dead humpback whale was about to come ashore on Perth's Cottesloe Beach yesterday, in what might have
                been a
                repeat of the cause of last week's $170,000 clean-up exercise on Scarborough Beach. Referring to the
                image at
                right <a href=Rottnest_chl/2014110404.html target="_blank">[zoom in]</a>
                <a href=Rottnest/2014110307.html target="_blank">[zoom in, SST]</a>,
                and taking the forecast winds into account, Prof Pattiaratchi advised authorities that towing the whale
                15km
                offshore of Rottnest Island would result in an even chance that ocean currents would take the carcass
                away. As
                far as we know, this is the first time that IMOS infrastructure has been used for an application of this
                nature.

            <h3>East Australian Current 'reversals' off Brisbane - 3 years in a row in June-July </h3>
            <a name=20140903><em>3 Sep 2014</em></a>

            <a href=Brisbane2/2012/2012070203.html target="_blank"><img src=Brisbane2/2012/2012070203.gif
                                                                        height=300></a>
            <a href=Brisbane2_chl/2012_64/2012070204.html target="_blank"><img src=Brisbane2_chl/2012_64/2012070204.gif
                                                                               height=300></a>
            <p>The Brisbane region is where the flow along the continental slope is most consistently fast and to the
                south,
                because of the East Australian Current, right? Well, yes, but sometimes the flow along the slope does
                turn
                northward (e.g. as we discussed <a href=#20091220> with reference to the fate of AHS
                    <em>Centaur</em></a>). In
                fact, it has now done this in three June-July periods in succession, the <a
                    href=Brisbane2/Brisbane2201407.fli>most
                    recent one</a> resulting in some striking SST imagery. The imagery shows that the EAC is not
                actually
                reversed - its just displaced offshore.
            </p>
            <p>Data from the IMOS EAC current meter array, which was deployed to measure the transport of this most
                important of Australia's ocean currents at a critical location, are <a href=technews.htm> now
                    available</a>
                and not surprisingly the data are rich with interesting features. One of these is a month-long anomaly
                in
                June-July 2012 that was an example of the EAC not flowing along the continental slope. This event was
                monitored in real-time by <a href=sst_anom/2012/20120611.html>satellite observations</a> of low sea
                level,
                low surface temperatures and high chlorophyll, which all show that the flow of the EAC was displaced
                offshore by a cyclonic eddy. What the current meter data (e.g. from the <a
                    href=timeseries/ANMN_P10/EAC2-2012-WORKHORSE-ADCP-81_zt.html>ADCP at 80m in 2000m</a>) reveal is
                that on
                <a href=Brisbane2/2012/2012060709.html>7 June</a> the flow velocity off Brisbane suddenly dropped from
                normal values to near-zero, where it stayed until <a href=Brisbane2/2012/2012071109.html>11 July</a>.
                During
                that period of near-zero flow along the 2000m isobath, the flow farther offshore at the other instrument
                moorings swung from shoreward on <a href=Brisbane2/2012/2012062104.html>21 June</a> to northward on <a
                    href=Brisbane2/2012/2012070203.html>2 July</a> (as shown at right) then to seaward on <a
                    href=Brisbane2/2012/2012070405.html>4 July</a> before turning south on 11 July and accellerating to
                speeds in excess of 1m/s by 15 July. The satellite data show that this sequence of events can be
                explained
                by the movement of the cyclonic eddy that in early June was centered more than 100km NE of the array (at
                26.4S 155.4E) but then moved west and subsequently south, passing through the array in early July then
                continuing along the continental slope.
            </p>
            <p>Cyclonic eddies also appeared inshore of the EAC in October 2012 (e.g. see <a
                    href=Brisbane2/2012/2012102514.html>25 Oct</a> although on this occasion the eddy was quite small)
                and
                in the next two years (e.g. in 2013: <a href=Brisbane2/2013/2013060415.html>4 June</a>, <a
                    href=Brisbane2/2013/2013062504.html>25 June</a> and see also the <a
                    href=Brisbane2_chl/2013062504.html>chlorophyll</a>
                image, and in 2014: <a href=Brisbane2/2014071715.html>15 July</a> as mentioned above).
            </p>
            <p> These reversals are important for a number of reasons. To mention just two: 1) they are responsible for
            a
            large amount of cross-shelf exchange (as can be seen in the chlorophyll images as well as the u-component
            velocity timeseries) with potentially major consequences for transport of fish larvae and everything else in
            the water - near Brisbane and farther south, and 2) turbines harvesting energy from the flow would be
            affected.

            This honour probably goes to one of the passages of the Buccaneer Archipelago. Sunday Strait, for example,
            is
            the main shipping route into King Sound and the town of Derby. Hydrographic chart AUS 733 notes that flow
            speeds
            of ~10kt (~5m/s) occur there. We are unaware of any instrumental measurements to verify that estimate, but
            offer
            this observation: At 1630WST on 29 July 2014 (close to the time of maximum spring ebb tide), it took two
            250hp
            outboards running at 2700rpm to keep the Giant Tides Tour RIB stationary in Escape Pass <a
                href=misc/P1170050.MOV>as dramatic whirlpools swept by</a>. From this, the skipper estimated the flow
            speed
            to be 9kt.

            <h3>Malaysia Airlines MH370: estimated drift of buoyant wreckage</h3> <a name=20140704><em>4 July 2014</em></a>
        <p>
            <a href=misc/OM_af_MH370_18_tp3sl_line/20140318.html target="_blank"><img

            Australia coordinated the search of the sea surface for wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 from 18
            March
            to 28 April, 2014. The Drift Working Group assembled by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority used
            several
            techniques, throughout the search, to estimate the drift of potential wreckage as part of the optimisation
            of
            the conduct of search operations, which involved as many as 12 aircraft and 12 vessels from a number of
            nations.
            The focus of efforts shifted north-eastward along the '7th arc' from early March when it was thought the
            plane
            could have flown as far south as 45S, to 21S where the flight recorder's pinger signal was thought, in
            mid-April, to have been detected by <em>Ocean Shield</em>. </p>
            <p>
                The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's June 26 report <a
                    href=http://www.atsb.gov.au/mh370/mh370-definition-of-underwater-search-areas.aspx target="blank">"MH370
                    - Definition of Underwater Search Areas"</a> shows what is presently believed to be the most likely
                region of the crash. The panel at right shows two estimates of where three types of debris might have
                been
                distributed on 18 March when the search off Australia commenced. These simulations use the ATSB estimate
                of
                the <a href=misc/OM_af_MH370_18_tp3sl_line/20140308.html target="_blank">8 March</a> crash region, and
                CSIRO
                trajectory modelling based on the Bureau of Meteorology winds and ocean current (left panel), and IMOS
                <em>OceanCurrent</em>
                surface current (right panel). The red, black and blue dots represent items with three degrees of
                exposure
                to the wind, drifting downwind at 2.8%, 1% and 0% of the 10m wind velocity, in addition to the two
                estimates
                of the velocity of the water. By <a href=misc/OM_af_MH370_18_tp3sl_line/20140328.html target="_blank">28
                    March,</a> when the estimated location of the crash site was close to the updated location used
                here,
                our 90km x 700km rectangle of tracked particles is dispersed into a region of approximately 300km x
                500km.
                That 'drifted region' was searched until 4 April and again between 15 and 28 April (from 5-14 April the
                crash site was thought to be farther north, where potential pinger signals were detected). At the end of
                the
                search on <a href=misc/OM_af_MH370_18_tp3sl_line/20140428.html target="_blank">28 April</a>, the tracked
                particles in these two simulations, combined, occupy a 1500km x 1000km expanse of ocean.
            </p>
            <p>Could debris from the aircraft, if still afloat, wash up on the coast of WA? According to our simulations,
            this is indeed possible, but very unlikely. A few of the 2700 tracked particles are now <a
                href=misc/OM_af_MH370_18_tp3sl_line/20140629.html target="_blank">(29 June)</a> estimated to be at the
            edge of the continental shelf. Winter westerly winds could conceivably bring those ashore. The vast bulk of
            the tracked particles, however, are 900-2500km west of Australia.

            <h3>Pacific Ocean cool surface</h3> <a name=20140317><em>17 March 2014</em></a>
        <p>
            <a href=sst_anom/20140312.html><img src=sst_anom/20140312.png height=200></a>
            For several months now, the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and Australia has
            been a degree or more cooler than usual, as shown at right (click to enlarge). The satellite temperature
            image
            is rich in detail but it is far from being the whole story. Firstly, note how the cool patches are all
            depicted
            as rotating clockwise. We infer this rotation from the sea level map which features depressions at those
            places,
            consistent with a positive anomaly of the depth-integrated density, which could be caused by lower
            temperature
            and/or higher salinity. One hypothesis worth exploring is that reduced rainfall in that region has increased
            the
            surface salinity (by failing to balance evaporation). This reduces the near-surface gradient of density,
            allowing the wind to keep the thickness of the mixed-layer deeper than usual, thereby keeping the
            temperature
            lower than usual. This hypothesis may explain the measurements by Argo float 5902084, which sampled a
            near-surface salinity anomaly of <a href=profiles/5902084/20140311_5902084_193_0312.html> +0.25 in the upper
                100m</a>, but it does not explain the measurements by nearby float 5904257 which sampled a <a
                href=profiles/5904257/20140311_5904257_22_0312.html>more-normal vertical profile</a>. Here, the
            isotherms
            and isohalines are shifted down by about 100m, thus reducing the depth-integrated density anomaly and
            raising
            the surface elevation, even though the temperature anomaly at the surface is zero or even slightly negative.
            This downward shift could only have been caused by a local accumulation or convergence of EAC waters, such
            as
            might result from the net transport southwards along the shelf being temporarily reduced. The question is
            why
            this advective deepening of the surface layer was not accompanied by any increase of surface temperature,
            but a
            reduction instead.

            southern West Australia will produce anomalous ocean current conditions:- a weak (<0.2m/s) southward or
            southwestward flow (becoming weaker or slightly northward towards the end of the race) rather than the usual
            northward currents that are common at this time of the year.

            <p>The strong northward flow last week and <a href=Rottnest/2014021916.html>more recently</a> brought cooler
            water (21-22C) to the surface north of Rottnest Island, and this appears <a href=Rottnest/2014022019.html>today</a>
            to be coming south and into the race area. The image at right also shows the surface current estimated by
            the two IMOS HF radar systems near Perth; the northern one in magenta and the southern one in red. These
            estimates (which are also shown on <a href=http://www.mapswim.com> mapswim</a>) are least accurate at the
            edges of the coverage (as evidenced by the disagreement where they overlap) and are subject to many sources
            of interference. The Rottnest channel is at the very edge of the coverage, so the north/south component of
            the flow is very uncertain.

            Winds associated with the combination of low atmospheric pressure over SE Australia and high pressure west
            of
            Tasmania around <a href=GAB/20140204.html> 4 February 2014</a> caused an extremely strong upwelling event
            stretching from the Eyre Peninsula to Portland, so this season can certainly be characterised as one that
            started early (see below) and included at least one extreme event. The surface velocities associated with
            the
            upwelling were measured by both the SA-IMOS HF radars, as shown at right (click to enlarge), confirming
            expectations from basic theory and numerical modelling that the flow is essentially alongshore in the
            upwelling
            region, with just a small component directed offshore to drive the upwelling. The dynamics is very
            different,
            and more complex, outside the continental shelf in the deep ocean, where eddies exist and the wind-driven
            current is not constrained to follow the coast.<br>

            This year's fleet will negotiate three significant ocean eddies. The first, seen at right south-east of
            Jervis
            Bay on 20 Dec (click to enlarge), is unfavourable, but may dissipate or move farther offshore between now
            and
            Boxing Day. Skippers will want to keep inshore of this, other factors being equal. The 2nd is more
            important.
            Well-exploited all the way from 36S to about 39S, it could give yachts a significant advantage (1-4h) over
            those
            that do not find this river of southward flowing tropical water. Finally, an isolated warm-core eddy is off
            Tasmania's Freycinet Peninsula (42S), potentially giving a small boost to yachts keeping a bit farther east
            than
            others.

            <h3>Bonnie Coast upwelling: a strong, early start of the 2013-14 season</h3> <a name=20131121><em>21-28
                    November
                    2013</em></a>

            <a href=SAgulfs/2013/2013111706.html><img src=SAgulfs/2013/2013111706.gif height=200></a>
            The first upwelling of the 2013-14 season occurred from <a href=GAB/2013/20131116.html>11-17 November</a>
            due to
            strong south-east winds for several days. This was a strong event, especially for so early in the season,
            with
            the NOAA satellites seeing upwelled water at 12-13&#176 C, the HF radar seeing surface flows of 0.3m/s to
            the NW
            and tidegauges seeing coastal sea level depressed by 0.2m. This occurence of an early, strong upwelling in
            November is in contrast to the lack of strong upwelling until March during the <a href=#20130306>previous
                summer</a>. The event is quite well simulated by the Bluelink relocatable model <a
                href=misc/SAgulfs_Ex356_tv_1m_1h201311.fli> animation of hourly surface t and v</a> which shows
            excellent
            agreement with the HF radar data, and an upwelled plume of 15&#176 C water.
            <br><h3>22 Nov Update:</h3> A run of the model from <a href=misc/SAgulfs_Ex357_tv_1m_24h_s201311.fli>1 Nov
                to 24
                Nov</a> forecasts that strong upwelling will continue with colder water continuing to come to the
            surface
            this weekend.
            <br><h3>25 Nov Update:</h3> The latest few images (up to <a href=SAgulfs/2013/2013112419.html>19Z 24 Nov</a>
            vindicate the forecast, showing a plume of water at the surface that is even colder than last week (although
            the
            seasonally-changing colourbar does exaggerate this a little). Some frontal features appear to have shifted
            up to
            8km over 3h, or 0.75m/s, suggesting the flow is more energetic than forecast. The imagery also suggests that
            cold water is surfacing north of Kangaroo Island, and west of the Eyre Peninsula, where the HF radar has
            recorded flows of about 0.4m/s to the NW. It will be a few days before we see if the geostrophic velocity
            field
            agrees with this, and somewhat longer until we see what the IMOS ADCPs and CTDs have recorded. An Argo
            profile
            on <a href=profiles/5903302/20131121_5903302_146_1119.html>21 Nov</a> confirms that the offshore
            stratification
            was close to normal at that point, with the upwelled 12&#176 C water encountered at 250m.
            <br><h3>26 Nov Update:</h3> From <a href=http://bluewhalestudy.org>Peter Gill</a>: The first pygmy blue
            whale
            sightings for this upwelling season were reported south-east of Portland a week or two ago. Continued strong
            upwelling may draw larger aggregations of blue whales in coming months. Last year's season was certainly
            characterised by fewer blue whale sightings and weak upwelling.

                    2013</em></a>
        <p>

            By chance, the southard flows of both the Leeuwin Current (LC) and the East Australian Current (EAC) are
            presently being strongly impeded by eddies near the continental slope. On the west coast, the opposing force
            is
            from an anticyclonic (anti-clockwise rotating, warm-core, high sea level) eddy that is diverting the LC
            offshore, while on the east coast it is a cyclonic (clockwise, cold-core, low sea level) eddy that is
            achieving
            a similar effect. In both cases, some of the flow continues southward after completing a detour around the
            eddy
            but it is clear that there are impacts downstream (incuding the end of the warm spell off NSW discussed last
            month) when these diversions occur, as well as local impacts inshore of the eddies where there is suddenly
            much
            less tropical water. Both eddies have been sampled near their centres by Argo profilers. The 70m downward
            displacement (compared with climatology) in the <a
                href=profiles/5901677/20131108_5901677_179_1108.html>Ningaloo</a> eddy is in good agreement with our
            satellite-based projection, as is the 100m upward displacement in the <a

            waters over the NSW continental shelf and nearby in the Tasman Sea have been much warmer than usual since
            early
            August. Shelf waters off the Sydney-Woolongong shelf are presently 22&#176C or more in places as shown at
            right,
            about 4&#176C <a href=sst_anom/2013/20131009.html>warmer than usual</a>. A few Argo floats have sampled
            these
            anomalous conditions at key locations, confirming the satellite estimates and showing that the <a
                href=profiles/5903677/20131004_5903677_94_1006.html>warm anomaly</a> extends down to 600m at places. As
            is
            usually the case, however, the warmth of the regions directly affected by the East Australian Current is
            contrasted by a nearby <a href=profiles/5903917/20130916_5903917_66_0916.html> cold anomaly </a> that
            exceeds
            3&#176 between depths of 300 and 500m in the centre of a cyclonic eddy farther offshore. The cold anomaly is
            not
            great at the surface, so its location is less obvious in the thermal imagery. It showed up more in the
            altimeter

                Harbour, Feb 2013:</h3> Very strong upwelling and northward flow on the continental shelf near Coff's
            occured around 2 Feb 2013, as a small, intense cyclonic feature grew and then 'rolled' south down the coast.
            <a href=Brisbane/2013/2013011805.html>Two weeks earlier</a>, the East Australian current was flowing as a
            nearly-laminar jet along the continental slope and shelf between Fraser Island (25S) and Newcastle (33S),
            where it started flowing around a large warm-core eddy forming off <a href=LordHoweS/2013/2013011805.html>Sydney</a>.
            Cooler nearshore surface temperatures indicate that coastal upwelling was occurring from Stradbroke Island
            (27.5S) southwards, e.g. near <a href=Coffs/2013/2013011805.html>Coffs</a>, but especially south of Port
            Macquarie (31.5S). On <a href=Brisbane/2013/2013012914.html>29 Jan</a> it is clear from the (patchy) imagery
            that the upwelling had greatly increased following strong upwelling-favourable winds associated with a high
            pressure system centered on New Zealand and a low over Queensland from 24-<a href=ht/2013/20130128.html>28
                Jan</a>. The <a href=timeseries/ANMN_P5/CH070-1302-Workhorse-ADCP-69p6.html>CH070</a> and <a
                href=timeseries/ANMN_P5/CH100-1302-Workhorse-ADCP-95p2.html>CH100</a> ADCPs recorded the low bottom
            temperatures (17C) on and prior to 29 Jan, offshore-directed surface-layer flow to the SE on <a
                href=Coffs/2013/2013012806.html>28 Jan</a>(i.e.left of the wind as expected), then a strong reversal of
            the flow to the north on <a href=Coffs/2013/2013020222.html>2 Feb</a> which the HF radar shows to be
            associated with a small cyclonic feature centered over the 1000m isobath. This little eddy remains within
            the coverage of the radar until about <a href=Coffs/2013/2013020514.html>5 Feb</a> when it gets swept south.
            the physics of the eddy's formation is a fascinating combination of 1) geostrophic uplift of the isopycnals
            associated with the (essentially laminar) EAC, 2) ageostrophic uplift to balance the wind-driven surface
            Ekman transport, and 3) transfer of kinetic energy and cyclonic vorticity from the laminar flow to an
            isolated feature. This is a mechanism of first-order importance to across-shelf transport, so it is
            important that we obtain a more detailed understanding of it for many reasons.

            Kangaroo Island. The ADCP data agree fairly well with the HF radar and geostrophic estimates. On all 3
            occasions, the strong along-shelf flow and very high (isostatically adjusted) coastal sea level were driven
            by strong westerly winds in the Great Australian Bight in the previous days. The winds resulted from low
            pressure systems on <a href=ht/2011R00/20110521.html>21 May 2011</a>, <a href=ht/2012/20120904.html>4 Sept
                2012</a>, and <a href=ht/2012R00/20120508.html>8 May 2012</a> but these systems were clearly of very
            different nature, and the details of the history of the wind-stress field is possibly what explains the fact
            that the May 2011 and Sept 2012 systems drove strongest currents at the midshelf (SAM5) mooring, while the
            May 2012 system drove strongest currents at the outer shelf (SAM3) mooring. Aside: the <a

            reaches an annual peak shortly after the strong current event, because the South Australian Current is an
            extension of the Leeuwin Current, with relatively warm waters downwelling to depth along the shelf break
            during winter. The temperature maximum at 350m at the <a
                href=timeseries/ANMN_P5/SAM7DS-1111-Workhorse-ADCP-350.html>SAM7</a> mooring in 2012 is not until Sept
            (after the flow of the SAC has peaked) at which time <a href=SAgulfs/2012/2012091105.html>SST images</a>
            show a sharp front along the shelf break.

            from the East Australian Current is making life difficult for lobster fisher Steve Drake of Kiama (34.7S)
            because his marker buoys are being dragged under by strong flow along the shelf break near the 200m isobath
            <a
                href=SNSW/2013/2013061614.html>[16 June map]</a>. Mr Drake said the strong southward flow has persisted
            since 8 May. The image for <a href=SNSW/2013/2013051604.html>16 May 2013</a> (at right) shows the flow off
            Sydney-Jervis Bay in mid-May to be part of the East Australian Current going around an anticyclonic meander
            in
            the manner typical of incipient eddy-shedding. The new eddy became completely detached from the EAC around
            <a
                href=SNSW/2013/2013053103.html>31 May</a> when the cyclonic eddy discussed here <a
                href=#20130503>earlier</a> came close to the shelf break off Newcastle (33.5S). The new warm-core eddy
            is
            likely to persist for months off the southern NSW coast, possibly reaching Tasmania in some form in summer.
            The
            presence of a warm eddy off NSW does not always result in warm coastal water temperatures, because the
            strong
            southward flow can cause coastal upwelling (due to two processes; the bottom Ekman layer and thermal wind).
            But
            if the eddy, for whatever reason, comes very close to the coast there will be no cold water to upwell. This
            appears to have been the case off Sydney from mid-May to now, to the delight of <a
                href=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/last-chance-for-that-ocean-dip-20130607-2nuqd.html>beach-goers</a>.
            IMOS ANMN mooring data will confirm or refute this hypothesis, when available.</p>
            <p>
                Mr Drake's problems did not start in early May. From the 12th to 27th of April, his buoys were dragged
                under
                by strong <em>northward</em> flow. This is the first time he has seen this persist for more than a few
                days.
                The image for <a href=SNSW/2013/2013042307.html>23 April</a> shows that the northward flow was
                associated
                with the southern cyclonic eddy also mentioned here <a href=#20130503>earlier</a>. That cold-core eddy
                was
                sampled by IMOS glider mission sg516 <a href=misc/Dory4_2013050903.jpg>[SST image for 9 May with glider
                    track from Sydney 23 March to Narooma 28 May]</a> so analysis of those data will be valuable for

            batch of MODIS imagery, and compared these with the recent re-processing using SeaDAS6.4. Here, we list some
            of
            the clearest or interesting images of the Leeuwin Current in south-west WA, for 2002-2011. The peculiar
            seasonality of the Leeuwin current and the associated cycle of surface chlorophyll, appearing where you
            might

            <h3>Fourteen loops and counting: why do cyclonic eddies trap drifters?</h3> <a name=20130503><em>3 May
                    2013</em></a>
        <p><img src=LordHoweS/2013/2013050214.gif width=400>
            There is presently a satellite-tracked drifter apparently trapped in a cold-core eddy off NSW. On <a
                href=LordHoweS/2013/2013050214.html> 2 May 2013</a> it was at 33S 155.5E, doing ~30km-diameter clockwise
            loops in a 120km-diameter cyclonic eddy. The 'parent' cold-core eddy of the present, smaller eddy has
            existed
            for a long time but between <a href=LordHoweS/2013/2013031307.html> 13 March</a> and <a
                href=LordHoweS/2013/2013031616.html> 16 March</a> it became elongated to the NNW. The drifter did its
            first
            cyclonic loop at the northern limit of this feature (32S 155E) on <a href=LordHoweS/2013/2013032021.html> 20
                March</a>, then proceeded to do many more as the eddy meandered about (the images around <a
                href=LordHoweS/2013/2013042421.html> 24 April</a> are the clearest). The MODIS image for <a
                href=LordHoweS_chl/2013041003.html> 10 April</a> shows that the eddy had low (near-surface)
            chlorophyll-a,
            in contrast to the other cyclonic eddy positioned a similar distance offshore, off Jervis Bay at 35S.
            Stepping
            back through time reveals that the difference between the eddies' chlorophyll concentations is explained by
            their different origins; the southern one having been formed over the continental shelf near
            Sydney-NewCastle
            around <a href=LordHoweS_chl/2013031303.html>13 March</a>. The tendency of drifters to remain in eddies has
            been
            noted before but we cannot recall an instance of a drifter doing so many loops in a cyclonic eddy in this
            region
            before. Does it matter? Yes, because it tells us something about the exchange of water between the eddy and
            its
            surroundings. It also suggests there may be some convergence at the surface and therefore downwelling at the
            centre of the eddy, and also that the eddy is certainly not a wavelike feature, with a sea level anomaly
            essentially un-coupled from any particular mass of water.

            of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data. Below are some highlights (listed clockwise from Qld) of what
            these
            data reveal about recent events in the ocean.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Townsville, Feb 2011:</h3> What caused the depth of the <a

                        href=NE/2011R00/20110202.html>Hint</a>
                <li><h3>Mackay, July 2011:</h3> The <a href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/index.html#east2QC2>2010-2012 summary
                        page for
                        the east</a> shows that the Elusive Reef (GBRELR, 21S 153E) ADCP is the one that measured the
                    steadiest, strongest flow. May-July 2011 stands out as a rare period of low flow speed. The
                    page-per-deployment plot for <a
                        href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/GBRELR-1103-Workhorse-ADCP-229.html>GBRELR-1103</a> shows no reason to
                    suspect an instrument malfunction. The flow speed reduces during the period from 23 April to 8 May
                    2011
                    (starting at 200m then finally reaching the surface) and remains low until 6 July 2011 when it
                    suddenly
                    increases again. The reason for this appears to be that a cyclonic eddy came very close to the ADCP,
                    diverting the East Australian Current away from it, as can be seen by comparing our gridded sea
                    level
                    map for <a href=NE/2011R00/20110607.html>7 June</a> (a day in the middle of the event when Cryosat
                    data
                    is dense near the mooring, so the eddy is well observed) with the map for <a
                        href=NE/2011R00/20110412.html>12 April</a> when comparable Cryosat coverage shows normal
                    conditions
                    before the event, and <a href=NE/2011R00/20110716.html>16 July</a>, when the eddy has moved north,
                    away
                    from the mooring.
                <li><h3>Coffs, May 2012:</h3> Why is the flow suddenly northward, and bottom temperature raised, on
                    16-18 May
                    at the <a href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/CH070-1205-Workhorse-ADCP-67p9.html>Coffs Harbour 70m ADCP</a>? <a
                        href=Coffs/2012/2012051805.html> SST and HF radar</a> make it clear.
                <li><h3>Coffs, Aug-Sep 2012:</h3> The <a href=#20120813>EAC disappearing act of Aug 2012</a> was thought
                    to be
                    associated with a sudden wind-driven northward current pulse on 10 August and associated vertical
                    mixing, occurring at a time of minimal flow of EAC waters along shelf. The <a
                        href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/CH070-1207-Workhorse-ADCP-68p5.html>CH070 </a> and <a
                        href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/CH100-1207-Workhorse-ADCP-97p9.html> CH100</a> ADCPs certainly recorded
                    the
                    northward current pulse but no temperature rise at the bottom due to vertical mixing is evident.
                    The southward resurgence of the EAC along the shelf was recorded by the ADCPs, HF radar, a drifter
                    and
                    also SST and altimetry. Most of the EAC was still flowing around the cyclonic eddy off the
                    continental
                    shelf in late Sep 2012 <a href=SE/2012/20120916.html> [altimetry for 16 Sep]</a> <a
                        href=Brisbane/2012/2012092014.html> SST for 20 Sep</a>. Over the following weeks, the warm water
                    resumed its usual southward path over the continental shelf. The advancing 'nose' of the
                    near-surface
                    flow had a complex horizontal structure <a href=Coffs/2012/2012092005.html>[20]</a> <a
                        href=Coffs/2012/2012092116.html>[21]</a> <a href=Coffs/2012/2012092504.html>[25]</a> and <a
                        href=Coffs/2012/2012092804.html>[28]</a> Sep zoom-ins. We cannot, of course see the spatial
                    structure at depth but it is clearly very different to the surface flow, as evidenced by the
                    northward
                    or near-zero flow recorded by the <a href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/CH100-1209-Workhorse-ADCP-95.html>100m
                        ADCP</a> at depth from 14-28 Sep.
                <li><h3>Coffs-Sydney, April 2012:</h3> On <a href=#20120420>20 April 2012</a> we speculated about the
                    impact
                    of a large Coastal Trapped Wave that we could see (in tidegauge data) travelling up the NSW coast.
                    ANMN
                    mooring data clearly show now that the anomalous northward pulse was indeed about 0.5m/s as
                    anticipated,
                    off Sydney around 10 April, as shown in the depth-time plots of <a

                    passage over the mooring line of the southern edge of a growing Leeuwin Current warm-core eddy. This
                    eddy was south of the line by <a href=DonPer/2012/2012013020.html>30 Jan</a> (after a period of
                    alternating hot and cold winds which affected both the SST and inner-shelf currents) so the currents
                    became more westward. The flow at the ADCPs switched back to southward on <a

                    just
                    because of that. The beautiful SST image for <a href=DonPer/2012/2012022805.html>28 Feb</a> shows

                    very
                    strong southward flow in the upper 200m from 28 Jun to 16 July. The SST image for <a

                    of
                    the mooring, while the <a href=DonPer/2012/DonPer201207.fli> animation for the month</a> shows how
                    the

                        href=NWS/2012/2012031617.html>[map view]</a>, presumably because the cyclone did not track along
                    the

                        href=ht/2012R00/20120728.html>off the land</a> had cooled the inner-shelf waters, causing plumes
                    of
                    dense water to flow seaward. Many sub-mesoscale cyclonic eddies can be seen in the animation, e.g.

                    ~0.5m/s were measured by the ADCPs, providing valuable information to help us understand these small
                    features which are attracting oceanographers' attention for a number of reasons.

            <h3>Strong northeastward currents on the SE Tasmanian shelf generate a lee eddy behind Tasman Island:- IMOS
                glider confirms a model prediction</h3> <a name=20130403><em>3-12 April 2013</em></a>
        <p><a href=misc/glider_SETAS_20130403.jpg><img src=misc/glider_SETAS_20130403.jpg width=25%></a>
            An IMOS Slocum glider sampling the Storm Bay line out from Hobart encountered extremely strong currents
            towards
            the NE recently, sweeping it up the Tasmanian coast towards Maria Island as shown at right. The glider's
            track
            also included a few unplanned loops. One of these was east of the southern tip of the Tasman Peninsula, over
            the
            mid-shelf between Tasman Island and the Hippolyte Rocks. A CSIRO experimental <a
                href=misc/anim_setas_plan_20130403.fli>near-real-time model simulation</a> has an anti-cyclonic eddy, at
            about the same location as the glider's loop, that appears to be a topographic lee eddy resulting from the
            strong (nearly 1m/s) alongshelf flow streaming past the SE tip of the Tasman Peninsula. <a
                href=http://www.emg.cmar.csiro.au/www/en/emg/projects/INFORMD/Near-Real-Time-Results/SE-Tas-Model.html>[more
                about the model, and real-time output]</a> <a href="install.htm"> [animation won't play?]</a> <br>
            <h3>12 April update</h3> This <a href=misc/SETas_tp10m_t_Ex22720130407last14d.fli> [animation of model SST
                and
                'model drifters']</a> is a remarkably realistic-looking simulation of the situation, with some of the
            model
            drifters executing anti-clockwise loops on the shelf where the glider did its loops. Interestingly, the
            model
            predicts that if the glider had continued north in the cold current as far as the Freycinet Peninsula
            (42.2S),
            it might have sampled a very strange thing: a cold eddy rotating in the 'wrong' direction - anticlockwise.
            The
            explanation is that this cold water is also relatively fresh (about 35.1 at 60m according to the glider, in
            good
            agreement with the <a href=misc/SETas_sp60m_t_Ex22720130407last14d.fli> model</a>), so it is less dense, and
            therefore rotates anti-cyclonically. So an alternative explanation for the looped path of the glider is that
            it
            encountered one of the fresh eddies that the model predicts to be shed inshore of the sharp shelf-edge
            front.
            The lower salinity (relative to the EAC-influenced water offshore) of this fresher water on the Tasmanian
            shelf
            is not just from Tasmanian rivers, it is characteristic of waters south of the Sub-Tropical Front. For
            example,
            see nearby recent Argo profiles <a href=profiles/1901131/20130407_1901131_162_0406.html> west </a> and <a

        <p>
            The Bonney Coast (Portland, Vic, to Robe, SA) is possibly Australia's best-known upwelling hotspot with a
            well-documented upwelling season from December to March. The upwelling this year, however, has until

            all
            present: a high atmospheric pressure system west of Tasmania caused strong SE winds along the Bonney Coast,
            which set the sea level down and thermocline up. Cold water surfaced where the shelf is narrowest. The
            injection
            of nutrients to the photic zone caused the phytoplankton to grow. <h3>15 April Update:</h3> HF radar data
            (for
            SAG, covering the shelf west of Kangaroo Island) have now been added to the SST maps, quantifying the speed
            and
            timing of the northwestward velocity that was already evident from visual inspection of the SST imagery. The

            <h3>Ocean impact of STC Rusty monitored by IMOS gliders</h3> <em>28 Feb 2013 (updated 5 March)</em>
        <p> Severe Tropical Cyclone Rusty made landfall 100km east of Pt Hedland on 27 Feb 2013. An IMOS glider
            has
            recorded, for the first time in Australian waters, the impact on various water properties under cyclonic
            forcing
            conditions. Possibly the most notable of these impacts is that turbidity exceeded the intrument's range all
            the
            way to 30m (the bottom), as shown in Fig. 10 of a <a href=misc/KimberleyGlider_vsTCRusty1.pdf> WAIMOS
                note </a>.
            The impact of the cyclone is also clear in MODIS estimates of the <a href=MODIScomp/2013030306.html>chlorophyll-a
                concentration on 3 March</a>, which show a 250km-long plume extending seaward from the coast, <a

                Lambert</a> have also recorded the impact on sea level but this does not appear to have been large,
            relative to the large tidal range of the Pilbara coast. The elevated sea level, however, is expected to
            travel southwards along the Australian continental margin as a <a href=glossary.htm#CTW>Coastal Trapped

        <p><img src=misc/AlgalBloomBewareReef27-2-2013.jpeg width=25%> The far eastern coast of Victoria
            has one of Australia's upwelling 'hotspots'. An example of intense localised upwelling occurred in the last
            few
            weeks, starting on
            <a href=Syd-Hob/2013/2013021315.html>13 Feb</a>. The signal is clear off Marlo (longitude 148.5&#176E) by <a
                href=Syd-Hob/2013/2013021516.html>15 Feb</a>. According to satellite imagery, SST reached a minimum of
            16&#176C on <a href=Syd-Hob/2013/2013021705.html>17 Feb</a> and the cold plume extended 80 km to the south
            west.
            Observers at nearby Beware Reef measured surface temperatures as low as 15&#176C. The cold upwelling
            triggered a
            phytoplankton bloom that was clearly evident in a <a href=Syd-Hob_chl/2013022204.html>MODIS chl-a image for
                21
                Feb</a> and even more evident to the Beware Reef diver pictured, who noted only a few m visual range
            down to
            20m where it was quite dark, and only 12&#176C. The upwelling event appears to be due to the combined effect
            of
            1) the local wind which was upwelling-favourable from 10 Feb, and 2) dynamic uplift from the along-shelf
            flows
            associated with a warm-core EAC eddy. The event has been simulated quite well in near-real time using the
            Bluelink-developed nested-model system but the dynamics have not yet been fully explored. <a

        <p>Firstly, a reminder of a change to the way we are showing the strength of the surface current for
            panels
            such as the one for <a href=Syd-Hob/latest.html>Sydney-Hobart</a>. We have opted to double the number, in
            the
            east-west direction, of current vectors but halve the scale factor. So a 1kt current now shows as a shorter
            arrow, as indicated by the key. Bear this in mind if you compare this year's maps with previous years' ones.
            </p>
           <p> Now, the state of the East Australian current and its eddies: The 'speed hump' in Bass Strait that presented
            navigators with a difficult decision last year is not there this year. Instead, the rhumbline appears to be
            fairly free of any strong currents as far as we can tell from the latest satellite information. To the east
            of the rhumbline there is some favourable current clearly evident in the latest images so the warm,
            anticlockwise-rotating eddy is a feature worth watching in the next few days. There appears to have been a
            northward flow on the continental shelf of north-east Tasmania (as evidenced by the plume of cold water
            streaming north from Eddystone Pt) in the last few days but this feature is unlikely to persist until race
            day. The situation between Sydney and Cape Howe is very complex this year. There are two small cyclonic
            (clockwise rotating) eddies off the continental shelf, so the flow is adverse in places seaward of the 200m
            isobath. Over the shelf, however, there was evidently a favourable flow of about 1kt on 15 Dec, as can be
            seen from the <a href=Syd-Hob/2012/2012121504.html>southward drift of a satellite-tracked buoy</a>. The
            thermal imagery for <a href=SNSW/2012/2012121903.html>19 Dec</a> suggests there was a narrow warm stream
            flowing south past Jervis Bay over the outer continental shelf. It is unclear from the altimetry what the
            speed of the flow was. Navigators should watch the imagery for any evidence of this flow persisting til race
            time, which is quite possible but certainly not guaranteed. As usual, we wish all competitors an exciting
            but safe race and apologize in advance if the imagery on our website stops updating at any point due to a
            computer failure while our IT staff enjoy their holidays.

            <h3>An even-higher sea level event in the Great Australian Bight</h3> <em>29 August 2012</em>
        <p>Sea level in the GAB was about 1.8m above MSL at high tide on 23 August 2012. The low-pass filtered,
            barometrically-adjusted coastal sea level anomaly we used in our sea level mapping briefly reached 0.8m,
            topping
            the June value discussed below to become the highest (sub-tidal) sea level anomaly recorded in southern
            Australia this winter. It was caused by a deep low-pressure system that passed over Tasmania on <a
                href=GAB/2012/20120824.html>25 August</a>. The wind had a strong on-shore component at times, and the
            effect
            of this can be seen in the <a href=SAgulfs/2012/2012082412.html>24 August data from the HF radar</a>, which
            senses the total near-surface current velocity. But why is the along-shore component of the radar velocity
            clearly less than the estimate derived (by geostrophy) from the sea level maps? The answer to this probably
            includes several considerations. One, demonstrated so clearly off Perth in June, is that strong onshore
            winds
            raise coastal sea level ageostrophically, i.e., the sea level slope sets up to balance the force of the
            wind.
            Geostrophy, in contrast, is when the sea level slope is in equilibrium with the Coriolis force acting on the
            along-shore component of flow. This balance takes longer to establish than the set-up due to wind, which is
            why
            we low-pass filter the coastal sea level before inferring the alongshore flow from the map of sea level. It
            may
            be that in this case this approach did not remove enough of the sea level slope due to the onshore component
            of
            wind, yielding an erroneously-high estimate of the flow speed. Another possibility is that the altimeter
            estimates of low (-0.2m off Eyre Peninsula) sea level at the edge of the shelf were erroneous due to
            incomplete
            correction for the effects that large waves have on those measurements.

            What made the thin streak of warm EAC water south of Coffs Harbour suddenly disappear? Two things happened
            between 8 and 14 Aug, as shown in the larger-scale map for <a href=SE/2012/20120811.html>11 Aug 2012</a>.
            One is
            that the cold core eddy at 30S 155E, over the continental slope off Coffs Harbour, was restricting the
            southward
            flow of the East Australian Current at that point, so most of the flow went offshore around a big warm core
            eddy
            centered off Byron Bay. The consequence of this is that the thin streak of warm water south of Coffs was
            probably quite shallow. The other thing happening was that an atmospheric low pressure system was off NSW,
            centered at 34S 159E on 11 Aug. Strong southerly winds drive coastal currents northward and raise coastal
            sea
            level, as shown in the tidegauge data, but that would not change the surface temperature away from the
            coast.
            The cold southerlies cool the warm surface layer by extracting heat, but possibly more importantly, also by
            increasing the surface turbulence, mixing warm shallow layers with the water beneath. In summary, we think
            that
            the winds being so strong, and the flow volume so reduced, are what made the surface exression of the EAC
            off
            NSW disappear so fast. <a href=Brisbane/2012/2012082222.html>22 August update</a>: a fresh nose of warm
            surface
            waters can now be seen flowing south again between Coffs and the eddy offshore. <h3> April 2013 update:</h3>

            <a href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/CH070-1207-Workhorse-ADCP-68p5.html>CH070 </a> and <a
                href=timeseries/ANMN_P3/CH100-1207-Workhorse-ADCP-97p9.html> CH100</a> ADCPs certainly recorded the
            northward current pulse but no temperature rise at the bottom due to vertical mixing is evident.

                href=misc/FremantleBH201206.png><img src=misc/FremantleBH201206.png width=25%></a> On 10, <a
                href=GAB/2012/20120611.html>11</a> and 13 June 2012, the Bureau of Meteorology National Tidal Facility
            tide
            gauge at Hillarys, Perth, recorded non-tidal sea level anomalies of up to 0.8m above mean sea level. The WA
            Department of Transport tide gauge at Fremantle Boat Harbour recorded a similar surge but also a ~3h-period
            oscillation that contributed to the highest sea level ever recorded at Fremantle: 1.35m above mean sea
            level.
            Fortunately, these surges came at neap tide (click images to expand - Hillarys data courtesy of <a
                href=http://www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/projects/ntc/ntc.shtml>BoM</a>, Fremantle data and image
            courtesy of
            <a href=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/imarine/19263.asp>WA DoT</a>). The total sea level might have been an
            additional 0.3m otherwise (e.g., if it had occurred during the high spring tide a few days earlier). Low
            atmospheric pressure was a contributor to the high sea level but strong onshore (westerly) winds associated
            with
            the low pressure systems passing south of the mainland was the main cause. A consequence of these strong
            winds
            being onshore rather than alongshore is that they would not (in contrast to the <a
                href=glossary.htm#geostrophic>geostrophic</a> sea level-based estimates shown on our <a
                href=DonPer/2012/2012061105.html> map</a>) have generated particularly strong along-shore currents. This
            will be confirmed when the radar data processing resumes. Along the southern coast of Australia, where the
            winds
            blew along the shelf rather than across it, they generated a 0.75m non-tidal sea level anomaly on <a
                href=GAB/2012/20120614.html>14 June 2012</a> at Thevenard, where such events are more common. The surge
            has
            now passed through Portland, Vic (non-tidal anomaly 0.3m) and will possibly also be measurable soon east of
            Bass
            Strait. <br>

            <h3>A radar view of an intense cold eddy off Perth</h3> <em>9 June 2012</em>
        <p>Since <a href=DonPer/2012/2012052906.html> 29 May 2012 </a>, a satellite-tracked surface drifter has
            remained within a small eddy of cold water that we can see off Perth using satellites and the IMOS HF radar.
            The
            drifter has made several clockwise orbits of the eddy center but the radius of these orbits is so small
            (~10km)
            that the frequency of the position fixes are sometimes inadequate. The clockwise rotation of these very
            small
            eddies has been seen before in SST imagery and by drifters but this recent example is the first we have seen
            in
            real-time using HF radar. The tight radius of the eddy is well-resolved by the radar and the correspondence
            of
            the radar data with the SST imagery is <a href=DonPer/2012/2012052820.html> striking</a>. We have coloured
            the
            radar vectors according to whether the surface velocity field is divergent, neutral (|div(<h3>v</h3>)|<
            5E-6/s) or
            convergent. Trapping of drifters in features has often been taken to signal the existence of a convergent
            surface layer, and therefore downwelling, but the recent sequence of events has not yet yielded a simple
            interpretation. The cold eddy is the remains of an elongated cold feature sandwiched on <a
                href=CLeeu/2012/2012052720.html>27 May</a> between the warm eddy offshore, and warm water over the
            shelf.
            The eddy is now just a 'hole' in the surrounding region of warm water. We are interested in these features
            because many items such as fish and lobster larvae might also become aggregated in convergent eddies.<br>

            <h3>Warm beach temperatures at Sydney</h3> <em>11 May 2012</em>
        </article>
        <article> Sydney beachgoers are wondering why the ocean is so warm at the moment <a
                href=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/come-in-sydney-the-waters-sublime-20120510-1yfor.html
                target="blank">[Sydney Morning Herald]</a>. The answer is <em>not</em> that the whole Tasman Sea is
            warm. In
            fact, the only places that are warmer than usual for this time of year are quite close to Sydney. Much of
            the
            ocean between Sydney and New Zealand is significantly colder (by a degree or two) than usual <a
                href=sst_anom/2012/20120506.html>[SST anomaly]</a>. So why is it so warm near Sydney? The satellite
            image
            for <a href=LordHoweS/2012/2012042502.html>25 April</a> shows the East Australian Current streaming down the
            NSW
            continental shelf, with warm (23&#176C) water right up against the coast in places, as far as Woolongong
            where
            it went offshore, looping around a 100km-diameter anticyclonic eddy before rejoining the parent flow. The
            appearance of cooler eddies south of headlands is a clear sign of rapid southward flow along the coast.
            Animation <a href=misc/LordHoweS20120510last14d.fli>[fli format]</a> <a
                href=misc/LordHoweS20120510last14d.AVI>[avi
                format]</a> of the available images for following days shows how the along-shore flow of the EAC was
            interrupted as a cold-core, cyclonic eddy moved in from the deep ocean to the continental slope and shelf.
            By <a
                href=LordHoweS/2012/2012050815.html>[8 May]</a>, the EAC had changed course at Port Macquarie, with all
            of
            the EAC water flowing off the shelf into the deep ocean, isolating the anticyclonic eddy centered off Sydney
            from the rest of the EAC. This is the usual course of the EAC eddy-shedding process. It is not every time,
            however, that this process results in the inner shelf being flooded by warm EAC water. Strong flows of EAC
            water
            normally remain a bit farther offshore, so NSW beach temperatures are usually a few degrees lower than mid-
            or
            outer shelf temperatures. A common reason for sudden cooling is north-easterly winds, which, due to the
            rotation
            of the Earth, drive surface waters to the left, away from the coast, drawing the colder subsurface waters to
            the
            surface. Southerly or southwesterly winds have the opposite effect: they push the warm water up against the
            coast. The southerlies of late April - early May are surely a factor in the present case.

            <h3>High sea level on Vic, NSW and Qld coasts, 8-15 April 2012</h3> <a name=20120420> <em>20 April 2012</em></a>
        </article>
        <article> A wave of high sea level propagated northwards along the entire east Australian coast from <a
                href=GAB/2012/20120408.html>Bass Strait on 8 April</a> through <a href=SE/2012/20120410.html>NSW on 10
                April</a>, <a href=NE/2012/20120413.html> SE Qld on 13 April</a> to <a href=NE/2012/20120415.html> Cape
                York
                on 15 April</a>. It was the result of winds associated with a high pressure system that developed in the
            Great Australian Bight. This system developed farther south than normal for April, at a latitude more
            typical
            for summer-time systems (so it did not cause strong westerlies in the GAB). Unlike a summer system, however,
            it
            then tracked onto the SE mainland and up towards Qld. The result was that strong westerly winds off Vic
            preceded
            strong southerlies off NSW and strong south-easterlies off Qld. There is a class of low-frequency (period of
            days or longer), large-scale (100's km wavelength) ocean wave known as a Topographic Rossby wave, or Coastal
            Trapped Wave that propagates along continental shelves with the coast on the left in the southern hemisphere
            (i.e. northwards on the east coast) at a few hundred km per day depending on the depth profile of the shelf.
            They are generated by the along-shore component of the wind and reach largest amplitudes when the
            translocation
            of the strong winds matches the speed of the wave. This recent event appears to be a classic example of the
            local response to the wind being compounded by a Coastal Trapped Wave. The result was that sea level was
            about
            0.5m higher than expected for a day or two in places, something that only happens once or twice, if at all,
            each
            year. A northward shift of the prevailing current, of possibly 0.5m/s for a day or two, might have also
            occurred
            over the continental shelf but this is yet to be confirmed. Downwelling of the thermocline over the
            continental
            slope may also have occurred, especially near topographic irregularities such as Fraser Island. <h3>18 March

            <h3>Tasmanian beaches: as warm as Bondi? </h3> <em>11 Jan 2012</em>
        </article>
        <article>Ocean surface temperatures are presently 18 to 19&#176C off <a href=Tas/2012/2012010815.html> eastern
                Tasmania</a>, which is about <a href=sst_anom/2012/20120106.html>3&#176 above normal</a>. The same (or
            lower) temperature was recorded at Bondi Beach on Boxing Day 2011, but there it is about 3&#176
            <em>below</em>
            normal. The explanation for the levelling of the beach temperatures is probably as follows: the relatively
            cold
            Sydney temperature was the result of the combined influence of <a href=glossary.htm#upwelling>upwelling-favourable </a>
            north-easterly winds and the departure from the shelf, <a href=SNSW/2011/2011122518.html>just north of
                Sydney</a>, of the East Australian Current (as noted below). The warm Tasmanian temperatures are due in
            some
            measure to the presence off Tasmania of the large warm-core eddy that has come slowly south from NSW, even
            though the core temperature of that eddy is not high at the surface. <h3>Update:</h3> The southward flow of
            warm
            water continued through February, with the greatest positive anomaly occurring in the week of <a
                href=sst_anom/2012/20120225.html>25 Feb</a> when weather conditions compounded the effect of the local

            <h3>Sydney to Hobart yachtsmen: mind the speedhump in Bass Strait</h3> <em>20 December 2011</em>
        </article>
        <article>If our most recent current maps are any indication of what competitors will encounter in this year's
            Sydney-to-Hobart race, one of the key decisions might be whether to stick to the rhumbline and endure a weak
            adverse current in Bass Strait, or whether to try and pick up a stronger (possibly 2kt) tail current by
            going
            wide of Cape Howe. The more eastern route might also position yachts to pick up some tail current off
            Tasmania.
            The strong flow off southern NSW is the inside edge of a warm-core eddy shed from the East Australian
            Current in
            September. The eddy presently off Tasmania is the remnant of the very strong eddy formed off Sydney in <a
                href=SE/2011/20110301.html>March</a>. The EAC is well east of Sydney at present, so strong currents are
            not
            evidently affecting the region from Sydney to Ulladulla. The flows may change over the next few days,
            however,
            so navigators are advised, as always, to watch for updates.

            <h3>The Leeuwin Current and East Australian Current are both still extremely strong</h3> <em>9 December
                2011</em>
        </article>
        <article> Both of Australia's major boundary currents were stronger than usual in 2011. Off Perth, the strong
            Leeuwin Current caused water temperatures to be more than 4 degrees warmer than usual from <a
                href=sst_anom/2011/20110204.html>February</a> to <a href=sst_anom/2011/20110414.html>April</a>. The
            strong
            flow continued into the <a href=RechEyre/2011/2011062417.html>Great Australian Bight </a> where it created
            several very energetic warm core eddies, with flow speeds reaching 0.6m/s at times, according to
            satellite-tracked drifting buoys. Temperatures are a few degrees higher than usual <a
                href=sst_anom/2011/20111204.html>at present</a> off SW Australia, and the Leeuwin is rounding <a
                href=AlbEsp/2011/2011112505.html>Cape Leeuwin</a> as a powerful current, billowing seaward at several
            places
            instead of relaxing as it often does at this time of year. From Brisbane to Sydney, the strong East
            Australian
            Current early in the year produced the most energetic warm-core eddy measured by satellite altimetry off SE
            Australia. In <a href=SE/2011/20110301.html>March </a> the eddy was off southern NSW. Its waters are now
            evident
            south of <a href=Tas/2011/2011120105.html>Tasmania</a>.

            <h3>Extreme eddies off Sydney</h3> <a name=20110122><em>22 January 2011</em></a>
        </article>
        <article>Two extremely large ocean eddies are off Sydney at the moment, one warm, the other cold. The warm eddy
            is
            composed of a large mass of East Australian Current water that has been flowing very fast south from Qld for
            some time now, and is about to pinch off from the parent current to form an isolated eddy. The pinching-off
            process is associated with the westward movement of a huge and very energetic cold-core eddy, which we
            detect
            from space as a 150km-diameter area of low (-0.6m) sealevel <a href=SE/2011/20110117.html>[map for 17
                Jan]</a>.
            As this comes ever closer to the continental shelf between Newcastle and Port Macquarie, very cold water
            might
            upwell at the coast, from Port Stephens to Sydney, especially if there are winds from the NE to assist the
            process. If the warm eddy now off Sydney shifts southward then the present low coastal temperatures south of
            Jervis Bay will be replaced by high ones. This whole chain of events has been seen many times before, but
            not
            ever this strongly, from memory. Results of a quantitative analysis will be announced when they are
            available.

            they
            had the choice of northward flowing cold water over the continental shelf, or southward flowing warm water
            outside the 200m isobath. Most of the leading boats chose the warm water but from halfway across Bass
            Strait,
            this is not flowing towards Hobart, but veering east. Cold water on the Tasmanian continental shelf is
            flowing
            northwards but probably not very quickly.

            <h3>update on Sydney</h3> <em>May 18 2010</em>
        </article>
        <article>Beach water temperatures are still extremely high but the East Australian Current has now started to
            flow
            mostly away from the continental shelf at the latitude of Sydney, rather than towards the coast (as it has
            since
            late April), triggering the beginning of the end of the high temperatures. The explanation is faily complex:
            Between Sydney and Newcastle a clockwise-rotating, cold-core eddy has now become well established inshore of
            the
            EAC. Until the last few days, the EAC was flowing south around this cold-core eddy, feeding into a large
            pool of
            EAC water that is warmer than is normally seen off southern NSW at this time of year: <a
                href=sst_anom/2010/20100512.html>[difference from average for 12 May]</a>.
            The cold-core eddy has now grown so large that very little of the EAC is continuing south: most appears to
            be
            flowing offshore at the critical junction point at 34.5S, 152.5E: <a href=SNSW/2010/2010051619.html>[imagery
                for
                16 May]</a>. To complete this eddy-shedding process, the cold-core eddy off Newcastle is likely to merge
            with the larger cold-core eddy to the SE, thereby completely separating the two masses of warm EAC water:
            the
            parent body to the NE, and the newly-shed body to the south. <h3>Update:</h3> The eddy shedding is now
            complete:
