The Ocean Current redevelopment

This redevelopment is a layer of PHP files thats sits on top of the existing .htm files that have been machine generated over many years as part of the creation of the accompanying maps.

The PHP retrives the old files files (latest.htm files) and then jquery intercepts and recreates the anchor to target back through PHP 

Bootstrap CSS and JS is used to present back the proxied .htm files via PHP templates
